# Coordinate Descent (CD)

This is a (actively updated) paper list of **Coordinate Descent (CD)**, aka *Alternative Optimization*, which has an interesting relationship with *Expectation Maximization* (from an optimization viewpoint).

Note that sometimes CD is named as *coordinatewise minimization*.

  * "One could look for the most effective one, that one which maximizes the gradient (w.r.t. one component), at each stage".
  * "Another modification that might be worth considering would be to draw random numbers at each stage to determine the sequence in which the elementary operators would be applied."
